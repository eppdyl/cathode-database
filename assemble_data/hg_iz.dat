CROSS SECTION DATA FORMAT
In downloaded files, each collision process is defined by a block consisting of
1st line
Keyword in capitals indicating the type of the collision. Possible collision types are elastic, effective, excitation,
ionization, or attachment (capital letters required, key words are case sensitive), where "elastic" is used to denote
the elastic momentum transfer cross section and where "effective" denotes the total momentum transfer cross section (sum
of elastic momentum transfer and total inelastic cross sections).  The latter is useful for solving the Boltzmann
equation in the 2-term approximation.
2nd line
Name of the target particle species. This name is a character string, freely chosen by the user, e.g. "Ar". Optionally
for excitation processes, the name of the corresponding excited state can be specified on the same line, separated from
the first name either by arrow "->" (dash + greater than) or by double-head arrow "<->" (less than + dash +
greater than), e.g. "Ar -> Ar*" and "Ar <-> Ar*", respectively. In the later case BOLSIG+ will automatically
define the inverse superelastic process, constructing the superelastic cross-section by detailed balancing, and
considering the indicated excited state as the target. In this case, the ratio of statistical weights must be input in
the 3rd line (see below).
3rd line
For elastic and effective collisions, the ratio of the electron mass to the target particle mass. For excitation or
ionization collisions, the electron energy loss (nominally the threshold energy) in eV. For attachment, the 3rd line is
missing. In case of an excitation process where an excited state has been indicated on the 2nd line using double-head
arrow "<->", the 3rd line must specify also ratio of the statistical weights of the final state to the initial state
as the second parameter in 3rd line this is needed by BOLSIG+ to calculate the de-excitation cross-section. The
statistical weight ratio, if given, will also be used by the automatic superelastics option in BOLSIG+. If this ratio is
not provided then BOLSIG+ will assume it unity.
from 4th line (optionally)
User comments and reference information, maximum 100 lines. The only constraint on format is that these comment lines
must not start with a number.
Finally
Table of the cross section as a function of energy. The table starts and ends by a line of dashes "------" (at least 5),
and has otherwise two numbers per line: the energy in eV and the cross section in m2.

DATABASE:         SIGLO database
PERMLINK:         www.lxcat.net/SIGLO
DESCRIPTION:      The SIGLO database is the "in-house" data  used by the group GREPHE at LAPLACE in Toulouse. The data
                  are taken from different sources as indicated for each gas. Please refer to original sources in
                  publications.  
                  An early version of this data file, "siglo.sec", was distributed with BOLSIG.  The main changes in the
                  present version are :
                  The format has been changed to be compatible with BOLSIG+.
                  Scale factors have been incorporated in the data and no longer appear explicitly.
                  We have removed the CF4 cross section data because of their limited precision (probably due to
                  digitization errors).  For the moment our recommendation is to use the dataset in the Morgan
                  database.
                  He : The present data are from the compilation of A.V. Phelps (see reference in the Phelps data
                  base).
                  O2 : We recommend using the data in the Phelps database for this species.
                  H2 : We recommend using the data in the Phelps database for this species.
                  Cl2 : The present data are an updated compilation (Jan 2012) by J Gregorio and LC Pitchford.    
                  Cu : Feb 2012. Digitized from Tkachev A N, Fedenev A A and Yakovlenko S I, Laser Phys. vol.17, p. 775
                  (2007)
                  Kr :  Nov 2012.  We re-digitized the data from figs. 1 and 5 in H. Date, Y. Sakai and H. Tagashira, J.
                  Phys. D 22 1478 (1989).  With respect to the previous data from this same reference in the SIGLO
                  database, there are some changes in the threshold values and in the magnitudes of the inelastic cross
                  sections.
