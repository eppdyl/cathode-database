### DOCUMENT
# [1] M. T. Domonkos, "Evaluation of low-current orificed hollow cathodes," University of Michigan, 1999.
### SOFTWARE
# Plot digitized using Engauge Digitizer
### CAPTION
# Reduction of Cathode Internal Pressure for Spot-Mode Operation
### DATA
# Id (A), mdot (sccm of Xe), P (x10^(-3) Pa), propellant mass (amu), do (mm), Lo (mm)
### Notes
# Extracted from the overall plot; this data is for the AR3, at Id = 1A. Need to multiply pressure by 1e3 to obtain the correct values
