### DOCUMENT
# [1] M. Hayashi, “Determination of electron-xenon total excitation 100 eV , from experimental sections , from threshold to values of Townsend’s alpha,” J. Phys. D. Appl. Phys., vol. 16, pp. 581–589, 1983.
### SOFTWARE
# Plot digitized using Engauge Digitizer
### CAPTION
# Total collision cross-sections in xenon
### DATA
# Electron Energy (eV), Cross Section (Angstrom^2)
### NOTES
# These are ``recommended values'' based on 3 sets of experimental data.
# This is a log-log plot, the digitized data is log10 of the actual values.
