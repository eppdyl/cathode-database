### DOCUMENT
# [1] D. SIEGFRIED and P. WILBUR, “An investigation of mercury hollow cathode phenomena,” 13th Int. Electr. Propuls. Conf., 1978.
### SOFTWARE
# Plot digitized using Engauge Digitizer
### CAPTION
# Electron temperature in plume mode 
### DATA
# d (mm), Te (eV), Te linear (eV)
### NOTES
# The second Te data is from an arbitrary linear fit proposed by the authors --- this allows for better matching of model to experimental data
