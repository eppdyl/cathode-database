Siegfried's argon and xenon cathode

The insert was 15 to 20mm long and had a diameter of 3.8 mm; the cathode was operated with orifice plates having 0.51 and 0.76 mm diameter orifices


p. 99
The thermal loss for the considered cathode is modeled as
q_th = (526 * \InsertTemperature -  3.99e5)\EmissionLength\InsertDiameter
Both emission length and insert diameter are here in meters. The average insert surface temperature is in K.

Te = 0.8 eV for xenon
Te = 1.3 eV for argon

p. 100, 109
Experimental data obtained with cathode at do = 0.76 mm
Upper plots: mdot = 287 mA for argon, 92 mA for xenon; varying current
Lower plots: Id = 2.3 A; varying internal pressure
Argon: work function is 2.5 eV
Xenon: work function is 2.25 eV
