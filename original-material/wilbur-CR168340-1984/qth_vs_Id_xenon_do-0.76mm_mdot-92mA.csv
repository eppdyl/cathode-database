### DATA
# Id (A), qth (W/mm)
### NOTES
# This is the thermal loss of the cathode, as a function of discharge current --- for the particular case of interest! It was computed as follows:
# 1. Get qth vs. Tc for the model cathode (ref. 2). We used the "best estimate".
# 2. Get a "power fit" a*x^b + c for qth vs. Tc. This was done using MATLAB cftool toolbox.
# 3. Using the reported wall temperature as function of discharge current in ref. 1, calculate the corresponding qth using the fit: we now have qth as function of Id
# 4. One data point was missing for the wall temperature at (Id = 2.27 A), so we performed a linear fit to get it
# The a,b,c value for the power fit are as follows (with 95% confidence bounds)
# a =   1.459e-08  (8.342e-09, 2.084e-08)
# b =       2.612  (2.553, 2.671)
# c =      0.1734  (0.1552, 0.1916)
