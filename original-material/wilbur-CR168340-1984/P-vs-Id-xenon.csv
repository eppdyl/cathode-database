### DOCUMENT
#  [1] P. J. Wilbur, “Advanced Ion Thruster Research,”  NASA CR-168340, 1984.
### SOFTWARE
# Plot digitized using Engauge Digitizer
### CAPTION
# Internal pressure/Flow rate correlation for xenon 
### DATA
# Id (A), P/(mdot/do^2) (Torr - mm^2 / mA),  [P/(mdot/do^2) (Torr - mm^2 / mA)]_upper, [P/(mdot/do^2) (Torr - mm^2 / mA)]_lower
### NOTES
# The correlation varies with flows from 50 mA to 1300 mA and orifice diameters of 0.25 mm to 1.0 mm. The lower and upper bounds are given as corr_up and corr_low 
# Plot is p.117
# Proposed correlation fit is P/(mdot/do^2) = 0.0090 + 0.0040 I_D
