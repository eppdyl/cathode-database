### DOCUMENT
# [1] V. J. Friedly, "Hollow cathode operation at high discharge currents", M. Sc. Thesis, NASA CR-185238, 1990 
### DATA
# x(mm), ne (m^-3 x 10^-19), Id (A), mdot (mA), propellant mass (amu), do (mm), Lo (mm)
### CAPTION
# Fig. 14 - Effect of discharge current on centerline plasma property profiles
### NOTES
# Xenon cathode
# 6.4 mm outer tube, 0.74 mm orifice diameter => 4.7 mm insert diameter
# Lo is not specified so we set it as 1 mm
# Other quantities can be deduced from other plots
