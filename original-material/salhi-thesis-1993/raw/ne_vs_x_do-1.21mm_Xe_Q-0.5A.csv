### DOCUMENT
# [1] A. Salhi, "Theoretical and experimental studies of orificed, hollow cathode operation," The Ohio State University, 1993.
### SOFTWARE
# Plot digitized using Engauge Digitizer
### CAPTION
# Axial distribution of electron number density along the cathode center line
### DATA
# Id (A), mdot (A), do (mm), mass (amu), x (mm), log10(ne (1/cm3))  
### Notes
# Extracted from multiple plots (Figs 5.35 to Figs 5.36 pp100-102)
# Need to apply 10^ and multiply by 1e6 to get ne in 1/m3
