### DATA
# Id (A), log10(Electron Density) (1/m3), Propellant mass (amu), Insert diameter (mm), Insert temperature (degC), Mass flow rate (eqA), Orifice diameter (mm), Orifice length (mm), Plasma potential (V), Total pressure (Torr)
### NOTES
# Mercury cathode with a 0.76mm diameter orifice
# Table p. 14 of Ref. [1], p.4 of Ref. [2]. 
# Temperature data for the cases at 3.3 A are from Ref. [2] 
# Orifice length is from Ref. [3], p.130
# The insert temperature for the experiments at fixed Id = 3.31 A but varying mass flow rate are taken to be the same as the one reported for 3.31 A
# [4] Plots are p.101-104 for Argon and p.105-108 for Xenon
