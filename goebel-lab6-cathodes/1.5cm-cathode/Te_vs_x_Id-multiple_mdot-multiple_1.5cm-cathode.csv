### SOFTWARE
# Plot digitized using Engauge Digitizer
### CAPTION
# Electron temperature profiles in the 1.5-cm cathode at three xenon flow rates and 50 and 100 A
### DATA
# Id (A), mdot (sccm), x (cm), Te (eV), Te err- (eV), Te err+ (eV)
### NOTES
# The data for x and Te are in a JSON array format. 
# Error bounds are reported in err- and err+, when available (TeVerrm and TeVerrp, respectively)
