### Cathode data
This repository contains digitized data of hollow cathodes, and other useful data.

The list of cathodes will grow in time. At the moment, the following cathodes have been (partially) digitized:
- NSTAR
- NEXIS
- Siegfried and Wilbur Ar and Xe cathode 

The original material (i.e. plots, digitizer, csv or tsv files) is in the folder original-material. Each subfolder has a title, and a README for the paper of origin. The name of the folder is author-publication-year.
Multiple papers are merged to get the overall data for a single cathode.
